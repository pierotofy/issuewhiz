IssueWhiz automates the triaging of issues in your repositories. It helps streamline the process of categorizing issues and enforcing project's guidelines using customizable and flexible rules.

## Features

- Automatically label, close and comment on newly opened issues.
- Rules defined using boolean logic coupled with variables computed with LLM-based text classification.
- Save time and reduce manual triaging efforts.
- Easily customizable to fit specific needs.

In a nutshell, you can define boolean questions using natural language, such as:

 * A: Does this text look like a software bug report?
 * B: Is this about a frontend problem?
 * C: Is this about a backend problem?

And define rules to act on such questions:

 * if `A and B` --> Add label `bug frontend`
 * if `A and C` --> Add label `bug backend`
 * if `A` --> Add label `bug`
 * else --> Add comment `Thanks for opening an issue! We will triage this shortly.`

## Usage
 
 * Create a `.github/workflows/issuewhiz.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Issue Triage
on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
jobs:
  issue_triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - uses: pierotofy/issuewhiz@v1
        with:
          # Your OpenAI token (https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
          # Added to : https://github.com/<repo>/<name>/settings/secrets actions
          openAI: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_TOKEN }}

          # GitHub Token with write access to repository issues
          # (you can leave this unless you want to use a different user that "github-actions")
          ghToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

          # Optional filter, any line in an issue that begins with "#" 
          # will be discarded prior to LLM evaluation 
          filter: |
            - "#"
          
          # Define your boolean questions, which must evaluate to yes/no or true/false
          # <VAR>: <QUESTION>
          variables: |
            - A: "A question about using a software or seeking guidance on doing something?"
            - B: "Contains a suggestion for an improvement or a feature request?"
          
          # Boolean expressions evaluating to true will execute the actions listed next to it
          # Evaluation continues until there are no more expressions, or a "stop: true" action is found
          logic: |
            - "A and (not B)": [label: question, stop: true]
            - "B and (not A)": [label: enhancement, stop: true]
            - "(not A) and (not B)": [comment: "I'm not sure how to classify this one! I will close the issue", close: true]

          # Optional signature to append to each message posted by the bot
          signature: "p.s. I'm just an automated script, not a human being."
```

## Expressions

You can reference all of your variables in the boolean expressions, as well as the special `body`, `title` and `title_lowercase` variables, which contains the text of the issue body and title respectively. This can be useful for doing classical regex matches alongside LLM evaluation.

For example, to match the substring "bug:" in the issue title:

```yaml
logic: |
  - 'title ~= "bug:"': [stop: true]
```

You can use all the expressions supported by [Filtrex](https://github.com/joewalnes/filtrex):

There are only 2 types: numbers and strings. Numbers may be floating point or integers. Boolean logic is applied on the truthy value of values (e.g. any non-zero number is true, any non-empty string is true, otherwise false).
